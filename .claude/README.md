This directory contains Claude Code configuration for this project.

## Structure

- `commands/` - Custom slash commands that can be invoked with `/command-name`
- `settings.json` - Local settings (gitignored, not committed)

## Custom Commands

To create a custom slash command:

1. Create a new file in `commands/` (e.g., `commands/my-command.md`)
2. Add your command prompt/instructions in the file
3. Use it with `/my-command` in Claude Code
